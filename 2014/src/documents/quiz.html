		<li><span class="nr">2</span> Re-tweet the daily new task every day</li>
		<li><span class="nr">3</span> Solve the task and send the answer together with your Twitter name, using the form of each assigment on CRAFT’s website. Be prepared, because by the last 3 assigments it also counts how fast are you. (We’ll track the average time of your last 3 assigments solution)</li>
